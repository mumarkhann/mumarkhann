# 💼 About Me

🔧 I’m a **Business Central Technical & Functional Consultant** with a passion for building solutions that bridge ERP systems and modern web tech. 
 
🔗 I specialize in **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**, integrating it with services like **Node.js**, **React**, and external APIs to extend ERP functionality.

☁️ Currently exploring **AWS Cloud Engineering** to level up deployment, automation, and scalability.

🧠 Always up for solving complex business logic—be it through AL code, API orchestration, or backend automation.

🧟 Fun fact: I started coding at 16 trying to make a zombie server in CS 1.6… it became one of the top 100 servers globally out of 4,000.
